# BookPedia-KMP

BookPedia-KMP is a Kotlin Multiplatform application demonstrating a list and detail screen with features such as searching, displaying book information, and saving favorite books. The app uses **Kotlin Multiplatform** for cross-platform development with a focus on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Desktop**. It fetches book data from the [Open Library API](http://openlibrary.org/) and provides an interface to display book lists, view details, and mark books as favorites.
